/**
 * @file agfx_native.h
 * @brief Escape hatch: unwraps AGFX objects into the backend objects they are built on, so
 *        third-party libraries that speak a native API directly (DLSS, FSR, XeSS, MetalFX, Optick,
 *        RenderDoc, PIX, a custom compute pass) can be plugged into an AGFX renderer.
 *
 * Including this header does nothing on its own. Define the backend you want *before* including it:
 *
 * @code
 *   #define AGFX_EXPOSE_D3D12   // pulls in <d3d12.h> and <dxgi1_6.h>
 *   #define AGFX_EXPOSE_METAL   // pulls in <Metal/Metal.h> and <QuartzCore/CAMetalLayer.h>
 *   #include <agfx/agfx_native.h>
 * @endcode
 *
 * The defines gate the *declarations*, not the implementations: the accessors are always compiled
 * into the library for whichever backend was built. So the define costs you nothing but the native
 * headers, and getting it wrong is a compile error rather than a link-time surprise.
 *
 * @note Ownership is never transferred. Every accessor returns a borrowed reference that AGFX still
 *       owns and destroys; it stays valid exactly as long as the AGFX object wrapping it does. Do
 *       not Release() a D3D12 object, and do not assume a returned object outlives an
 *       agfxSwapChainResize or an agfx*Destroy. If you need it longer, retain it yourself.
 *
 * @note AGFX does not observe what you do behind its back. It cannot know that a native library
 *       transitioned a resource, opened an encoder, or wrote a texture. Two rules follow, and both
 *       are easier to break than they look:
 *
 *       1. **Resource states are yours to restore.** Transition resources into whatever the native
 *          library documents *using AGFX barriers* before handing them over, and leave them in a
 *          state AGFX's next use expects. See `agfx-synchronization`.
 *       2. **Hand over a command buffer only outside a pass.** Native libraries that record work
 *          (every upscaler does) open their own encoder/command-list scope. On Metal, calling one
 *          while an agfxRenderPass or agfxComputePass is still open is invalid -- Metal permits
 *          exactly one open encoder per command buffer. End the pass first.
 *
 * @note Resources the native library creates for itself are invisible to AGFX. On Metal that
 *       matters concretely: they are not in AGFX's residency set, and a non-resident resource is a
 *       GPU fault. Add them yourself via agfxNativeGetMTLResidencySet, then call
 *       agfxDeviceMakeResourcesResident. The reverse direction -- adopting a native texture *into*
 *       an agfxTexture so the rest of AGFX can render to it -- is deliberately not offered here;
 *       it needs real ownership and view/bindless plumbing, not a cast.
