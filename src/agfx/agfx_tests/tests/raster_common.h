// Shared scaffolding for the rasterizer-state tests (wireframe, topology, cull mode, front face,
// fragment discard, push-constant color).
//
// Every one of those draws the exact same geometry with the exact same shader
// (data/shaders/tests/raster.hlsl) and differs only in a handful of agfxRenderPipeline fields and
// the push constants. Copying the full C / C++ / ez setup into each of the six files would be six
// near-identical copies of ~200 lines whose only interesting content is three struct fields — so
// the setup lives here once, parameterized by RasterState, and each test file is left holding only
// the state under test and its golden.
//
// The one entry point deliberately covers all three API flavors: the flavors must produce
// byte-identical images for the same state, and routing them through one function makes that a
// property of the code rather than something to keep in sync by hand across six files.
