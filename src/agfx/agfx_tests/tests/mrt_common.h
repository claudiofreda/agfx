// Shared scaffolding for the MRT test: one render pass writing two color attachments, then a compute
// pass summing them into a third texture.
//
// Only one test uses this today, but it follows the same split as the other families so the three
// API flavors are written once and are guaranteed to drive identical work — which is the property
// the suite is really asserting when it runs C, C++ and ez against a single golden.
