// Shared scaffolding for the alpha-blending tests: one per agfxBlendOperation, one per
// agfxBlendFactor, and the canonical src-alpha over one-minus-src-alpha case.
//
// Structurally this is depth_common.h's sibling -- a list of draws sharing one render pass, each
// with its own pipeline state and push constants -- for the same reason: a blend result is only
// observable against a destination that an earlier draw put there. It is deliberately *not* the same
// file. These tests bind no depth attachment at all, and folding both families into one BlendDepthState
// would mean every depth test carried blend fields it never sets and vice versa.
//
// The scene is fixed (see data/shaders/tests/blend.hlsl); what a test varies is only the blend state
// on the second draw. The source color and alpha live here rather than in each test so that every
// golden in the family is comparable against every other.
