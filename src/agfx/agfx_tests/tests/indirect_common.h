// Shared scaffolding for the indirect (GPU-driven submission) tests: draw, draw indexed, draw mesh,
// draw task+mesh, and dispatch, each in a one-command and a three-command flavor.
//
// Same reasoning as raster_common.h and mesh_common.h, with more force behind it. Every indirect
// test runs the identical seven-step sequence -- zero the count, barrier the bundle to
// UNORDERED_ACCESS, dispatch a producer that appends commands, UAV-barrier, prepare, barrier to
// INDIRECT_ARGUMENT, replay -- and differs only in which bundle type it asks for and how many
// commands it appends. Nine tests times three API flavors is 27 copies of that sequence, and the
// sequence is exactly the part that is easy to get subtly wrong, so it lives here once.
//
// Two things make centralizing this more than a convenience:
//
// 1. Prepare and Execute must be handed *identical* agfxIndirectBundleExecuteInfo contents. Metal
//    bakes the push constants into each pre-encoded ICB command at prepare time and cannot patch
//    them at execute time, while D3D12 only reads them at execute time -- so a host that fills them
//    on one and not the other passes on Windows and renders black on macOS. ExecuteInfo() below is
//    the single constructor both calls go through, so they cannot drift.
//
// 2. The consumer render pipeline must set supportsIndirect. Without it Metal cannot legally
//    reference the PSO from an ICB and faults the GPU rather than reporting a validation error;
//    D3D12 has no such requirement, so forgetting it is invisible on Windows.
//
// Indirect support is optional, so RenderIndirect reports an unsupporting device as
// IndirectResult::Unsupported and the caller skips -- as mesh_common.h does for mesh shading. The
// mesh-bundle kinds require *both* capabilities.
