// Shared scaffolding for the tests that point a render pass at one subresource of a multi-subresource
// texture: the clear face/slice/mip family, and the render-to face/slice/mip family.
//
// Both families ask the same question — does what the pass does land on exactly the subresource the
// render target names, and on nothing else? — and differ only in which axis of the subresource index
// is non-zero and in whether the pass draws anything. So the setup lives here once, parameterized by
// SubresourceCase, and each test file carries only its texture shape and its golden.
//
// The interesting half of these tests is the negative half. A pass that affected the whole texture
// instead of the named face/slice/mip produces a *correct-looking* target subresource, so the golden
// alone would pass it. Every other subresource is therefore seeded with a distinct pattern up front
// and checked byte-exact afterwards; that check is what actually holds the mipLevel/arrayLayer fields
// of agfxRenderTargetCreateInfo to account.
