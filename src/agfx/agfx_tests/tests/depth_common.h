// Shared scaffolding for the depth-state tests: depth clamp, the eight depth comparison functions,
// and depth write disabled.
//
// Same reasoning as raster_common.h, plus one thing those tests never needed: a depth attachment.
// These are the first tests in the suite to bind one, so the depth texture, its render target, the
// DEPTH_WRITE barrier and the pass's depth attachment all live here rather than being reinvented
// three times per test family.
//
// The other reason this is centralized is that a depth test is rarely one draw. Establishing a known
// depth buffer to test *against* takes a prior draw that writes it, and proving a depth write landed
// takes a later draw that reads it -- so DepthState is a *list* of draws sharing one render pass and
// one depth buffer, not a single pipeline state. Each draw carries its own depth state and push
// constants, which is what lets one shader and one host path serve all three families.
