// Shared scaffolding for the cross-queue handoff tests ("copy queue to render queue", "compute
// queue to render queue").
//
// Both are the same three-submission shape and differ only in who produces the texture: the
// graphics queue transitions it into the producer's state and signals, a second queue (transfer or
// compute) writes it and signals, and the graphics queue waits on that and samples the result in a
// render pass. The queues are ordered purely by GPU-side agfxCommandQueueSignal/Wait on one shared
// fence — the CPU blocks once, at the very end — so nothing is accidentally serialized by a CPU
// stall the way a fence.Wait() between steps would do.
//
// What they pin down: that work recorded on a non-graphics queue is visible to a later graphics
// submission that waited on its fence. Drop the cross-queue wait and the draw samples a texture the
// producer has not landed in yet, so the golden comes back cleared or torn.
//
// Only the C and C++ flavors exist. ez owns its own graphics queue and submits frames internally,
// with no way to interleave a submission from a second queue into that ordering — the handoff these
// tests are about is not expressible through it, so neither test registers an Ez case.
//
// Same reasoning as raster_common.h: routing both producers and both flavors through one entry
// point makes "the four combinations agree" a property of the code rather than something kept in
// sync by hand across four copies of ~250 lines.
