// Shared scaffolding for the sampler-state tests (address mode, filter).
//
// Each of those seeds one 64x64 source texture with texture_ops.hlsl:main_write_cs, then samples it
// into a 64x64 destination through sampling.hlsl:main_sample_2d_cs. The only things that vary are
// the agfxSamplerCreateInfo and the uv scale/offset handed to the sampling shader — everything else
// (device, views, pipelines, barriers, readback) is identical across every variant and all three API
// flavors, which is ~200 lines that would otherwise be copied per file. Same reasoning as
// raster_common.h.
//
// Routing all three flavors through one entry point also makes "C, C++ and ez produce the same
// image for the same sampler" a property of the code rather than something kept in sync by hand.
