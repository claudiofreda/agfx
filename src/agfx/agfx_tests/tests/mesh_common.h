// Shared scaffolding for the mesh-shading tests (mesh-only, and task + mesh).
//
// Same reasoning as raster_common.h: both tests build the same render target, render pass and
// fragment stage and differ only in whether the pipeline carries a task shader, so the setup lives
// here once and each test file holds only the state under test and its golden.
//
// Unlike the raster tests, these can legitimately not run: mesh shading is optional. RenderMesh
// reports that as MeshResult::Unsupported so the caller can skip rather than fail -- a hard failure
// on a device without mesh shaders would be a false alarm, and silently passing would be worse.
