// Shared scaffolding for the render pass action tests (load op LOAD / CLEAR / DONT_CARE, each with
// store op STORE).
//
// Store DONT_CARE is deliberately not covered: it leaves the attachment's contents undefined after
// the pass, so there is nothing a golden could assert, and D3D12 does not support it in the first
// place. That leaves the three load ops as the whole matrix.
//
// The mechanism every one of these tests shares: seed the attachment with a distinct pattern
// *before* the pass, then run a pass whose only interesting property is its load op, and look at
// what happened to the pixels the draw did not touch. That is why the seed and the region helpers
// live here — the assertions are about the background, not about the draw, and each test file is
// left holding one load op and one expectation about that background.
