// Shared scaffolding for the sampler comparison tests: one per agfxComparisonFunction, driving
// data/shaders/tests/sampling_comparison.hlsl.
//
// Separate from sampling_common.h rather than folded into it, because almost nothing is shared. A
// comparison sampler needs a *depth* source, which means a depth texture, a render pass to establish
// its contents, and an R32F texture view to read it back through — none of which the color-sampling
// path has any use for. What is shared is the idea, not the code.
//
// The source depth is uniform, and the destination is split into three vertical bands whose
// reference values straddle it: nearer, exactly equal, farther. Which bands survive names the
// comparison function uniquely, on the same principle as the depth *test* tests:
//
//   NEVER         -> nothing
//   LESS          -> nearer
//   EQUAL         -> equal
//   LESS_EQUAL    -> nearer + equal
//   GREATER       -> farther
//   NOT_EQUAL     -> nearer + farther
//   GREATER_EQUAL -> equal + farther
//   ALWAYS        -> all three
//
// Because the expected bands are known analytically, these tests do not lean on their goldens as the
// oracle: ExpectedBands() states the answer up front, and a golden captured against a broken backend
// cannot bless it.
